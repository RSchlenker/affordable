# affordable

This project is supposed to provide some functions to be used to plan ones financial future. It aims to answer some the following questions:
* Can I afford buying a house?
* Will I be able to have children?
* ...

> This project is in a __Work-in-Progress__ state at the moment.

## Basic idea
* Create a simple-to-program interface using functional-programming and javascript to plan ones future.
* Simple, atomar functions can be combined to simulate a more complex financial future.
* The aim is NOT to provide a most accurate result since these calculations tend to be broad anyway, but rather provide a broad overview if investment / lifestyle X or Y is affordable

## Getting started
* Checkout ```tests/unit/core/simulator.spec.js``` for an overview over the intended API-interface of the calculator
